# JavaScript Design Patterns Practice App

This project is a personal exercise to deepen understanding of common design patterns used in JavaScript. The goal is to implement and experiment with each pattern in a real codebase to better understand how and when to use them.

## Purpose

Design patterns offer proven solutions to common programming problems. By practicing them hands-on, I'm learning how to write more organized, flexible, and maintainable code.

## Patterns Covered

- **Module Pattern** – Encapsulation using closures and private state
- **Observer Pattern** – Event subscription and reactive design
- **Singleton Pattern** – Global instance control
- **Factory Pattern** – Object creation abstraction
- **Prototype Pattern** – Inheritance through prototypes
- **Command Pattern** – Encapsulated actions and undo/redo logic
- **Strategy Pattern** – Pluggable behavior through interchangeable functions
- **Decorator Pattern** – Dynamic behavior extension without altering original structure
- **Proxy Pattern** – Interception and access control
- **Mixin Pattern** – Reusable behavior composition

## How to Run

Each pattern has its own folder under `src/` with a simple example. To run them, just open the file in your browser or execute it with Node.js depending on the pattern.

```bash
node src/factory-pattern/example.js
